**SET-UP**

0. This project builds off Veyseh et al's MadDog project, which can be cloned here: https://github.com/amirveyseh/MadDog.

1. To use this development server, place it inside the root of the MadDog directory.

2. I have also included a modified server.py and an updated requirements.txt. These should replace prototype/app/server.py and requirements.txt in the original MadDog repository.

3. Run extension/reverse-mapper.py to create the definition => acronym dictionary.

4. To add the Chrome extension, upload the "extension" folder to chrome://extensions (will only work in developer mode).

5. To activate the extension's functionalities, you will have to run server.py as described in the original MadDog project. Then go to dev and run dev.py.

6. Try searching in Google Patents and enjoy!
